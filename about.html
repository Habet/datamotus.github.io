  - quote: I had an opportunity to attend a training that was tailored by Datamotus for Ameriabank. Main theme of the training was Conjoint analysis, but we also had introductory sessions on R programming language. The training was extremely practical and our team was equipped with good ground for designing and conducting a conjoint analysis on our own.

  - quote: Datamotus has conducted a series of training on statistics for our team. Due to professional and detailed delivery of training topics, we have enhanced our theoretical knowledge on statistics, as well as gained new skills in conducting inferential statistics. They have not only presented the theory, but also provided practical consultancy. As a result we managed to identify, discuss, analyze and find solutions for problems that arise during our work.

  - quote: I would like to tell you what an indispensable asset Datamotus has been to Duxton Consulting Group. What started out as a single job that you did for us, has grown into a productive and profitable relationship. Beyond the working partnership, what has evolved is a strong personal relationship. We really enjoy working with you guys! We always know that however bad our briefing is, and no matter how short the time frame, you’ll respond in a positive, pleasant manner. On behalf of all of us at Duxton Consulting Group, can I say what a pleasure and privilege it is to work with the Datamotus team.

We know how to plan, implement and finalize data mining projects starting from defining your business problem up to deploying the model.
