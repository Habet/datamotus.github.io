    title: Predictive Modeling
    desc: Predictive modeling is a process that uses data mining and probability to forecast outcomes for your business. Our models help predict a number of things such as which of your website surfers like certain products, which of your customers are more likely to make a purchase or which of them are more likely to churn in the nearest future.

    title: Churn modeling
    desc: Customer churn is one of the most unpleasant events for a business. Churn modeling is a tool that defines the steps of customer churn and helps you predict and avoid it over time. Without predicting churn, your actions will be based on mere assumptions and won’t usually have a positive impact.
